## Barkwire Pairs

In this drill, you're going to pair up with a partner to knock out a story for BarkWire Pairs, a dating app for dogs.

## List Dogs

You have the ability to look a list of dogs at `http://localhost:3000/dogs`, and you can add a dog at `http://localhost:3000/dogs/new`, but you can't see a single dog at `http://localhost:3000/dogs/:id`.

You need to:

* Make an container with a class of `dog`
* Look up the ID of the dog from the URL
* Look up the dog with that ID from `http://localhost:3000/api/dogs/:id`
* For the returned dog:
    * Give them an `h3` with the class of `name` that displays their name and links to their individual dog page
    * Display an image (give it a class of `profile-picture`) that displays their profile picture and has an alt tag of their name
    * Give them a paragraph tag with the class of bio that displays their bio
    * Add the dog to your container
